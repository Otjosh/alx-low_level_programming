This project "0x00.c" aims to teach and reinforce various concepts and skills related to C programming. It includes a series of tasks that cover different aspects of C programming, including preprocessor directives, compilation, assembly code generation, and basic programming concepts.

The learning objectives of this project include:

1. Understanding why C programming is considered awesome.
2. Learning about the inventors of C, specifically Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
3. Exploring the process that occurs when compiling a C program using the "gcc" command.
4. Understanding the concepts of the entry point and the "main" function in C programs.
5. Learning how to print text using the "printf," "puts," and "putchar" functions.
6. Getting familiar with the unary operator "sizeof" and its usage for determining the size of a specific type.
7. Understanding the compilation process using "gcc" and the default program name generated.
8. Familiarizing oneself with the official C coding style and how to check code compliance using the "betty-style" tool.
9. Learning how to find the appropriate header to include when using standard library functions.
10. Understanding how the "main" function influences the return value of the program.
